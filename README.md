# DVP4
Project surronding Knowledge graphs during the 4th semester on Aalborg University.

The Amazon ontology is defined in the 'Ontology' folder, wherein the files are used on https://purl.archive.org/domain/amazon, to further define namespaces.

The 'code' folder holds the code, which is needed to create the fully functioning Amazon Knowledge graph, which is done within the ConstructingKG.py file. Once this code has been run, the CompetencyQuestions.py file can be run to answer the competency questions from the project, and the KGStats.py file can be run to gain the stats of the knowledge graph. Furthermore, the PPRModel.py and PRModel.py files can be run to extract the weights from the knowledge graphs, which were used to evaluate the recommendation system. 

NOTE: TO RUN THE ABOVE FILES, "meta_Sports_and_Outdoors.json" AND "Sports_and_Outdoors_5.json" MUST BE MOVED TO THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE constructingKG.py FILE. A LARGE MEMORY IS ADDITIONALLY REQUIRED.
